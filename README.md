# Curriculum
Welcome to my software developer portfolio template built with Next.js and Bootstrap, which helps you showcase your work and skills as a software developer. With this portfolio, you'll be able to impress potential employers or clients with your work and expertise.

The page is hosted for free in github pages, built and deployed using github actions.

## Demo
To view a live demo, click here: https://koffiecode.com

## Prerequisites
* You can easily run the application using the supplied docker-compose file which will start a nodejs server and mount the current folder. 
* If you rather install it locally please get node.js following the instructions in [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md). Afterwards change the default npm global path:
    ```
    mkdir ~/.npm-global
    npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
    echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

## Reproducing
* In case you want to have the same result, please follow the installation steps from the [official page](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation).
* Move the content of the newly created folder to the root of the repository and replace all the existing folders.

## Project setup

## Customization

### Linking Portfolio to Github
You can link your portfolio to your Github account by changing the githubUserName in `portfolio.js` file.

```javascript
  //  portfolio.js
  githubUserName: 'YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE',
```

#### Using Emojis
For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.
